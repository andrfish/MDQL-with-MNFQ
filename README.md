# Running the code
The main file to run this code is the "/algorithm/mnfq_demo.py" file. Simply running "python mnfq_demo.py" will run the algorithm, with options hardcoded in the script on lines 19 through 32. The only dependency for this codebase is matplotlib to visualize the prediction results of MDQL with MNFQ.
